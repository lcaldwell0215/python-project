I chose the "Data Cleanup Tool for CSV Files" project.

This wil clean up messy CSV data by removing duplicates, correcting formatting issues, and save a cleaned CSV. It'll read the csv into a data frame, then clean it using strip. Then it'll apply a regular expression to remove non-alphanumerica characters from strings. It'll then save the cleaned data to either a database or just a new csv file using argument parameters.
